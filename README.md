# Munchkin App

### [Munchkin Server (backend)](https://github.com/Assisneto/munchkin_backend)

## Motivation

There are already many applications for the Munchkin board game, but there is something that bothers me about these solutions, I have to keep asking my power and level all the time as well as that of other players, because for that I created this project whose main characteristic this app that any another application don't have, the possibility share game information with other players in realtime using websocket.
